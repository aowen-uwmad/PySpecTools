# Notes on Doc Generation

This package uses Sphinx for automatic generation of documentation. To generate
docs, run `make html` or `make pdf` or another builder, and it will output the
documentation in a separate folder (../../PySpecTools-docs).

To edit the pages, simple edit the restructured text files in `source`, and
when you rebuild these changes should be reflected.

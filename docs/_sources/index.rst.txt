Introduction
------------
`PySpecTools` is a library written in Python 3.7 (and above) to help with analyzing spectroscopy and quantum chemistry data.
The motivation behind this is to provide an object-oriented way to analyze this kind of data, with reproducibility, collaboration,
and automation heavily in mind throughout the development process - this makes the library flexible for both beginner users
(i.e. with little knowledge in Python) and for power users (those who are proficient in Python).

As such, there are no explicitly programmed user interfaces for `PySpecTools` - the tools were built with analysis using
notebook environments such as `Jupyter`_, and removes most of the need for any custom interfacing.
